      <div><b>INTERIOR</b></div>
      <p>The primary purpose of your building&#39;s interior elements is to serve the needs and space requirements of
        its occupants. Defining features include walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and storage needs. Also, the
        heating, cooling, ventilation, plumbing, and electrical systems are arranged to meet the needs of each room and
        space.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>INSPECTION PROCESS</b></p>
      <p>As documented by this report, the focus of the building inspection is on the functional rather than the
        appearance aspects of your building&#39;s interior elements. The investigation of the internal elements includes
        the examination of walls ceilings and floors; steps, stairways, and railings; balconies; countertops and a
        representative number of installed cabinets, and a representative number of doors and windows. This inspection
        does not typically include an examination of surface finishes such as paint, wallpaper, or other forms of finish
        treatment, or installed elements such as carpeting, window treatments, central vacuums, household appliances,
        and recreational facilities (pools, spas, etc.).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The primary mode of examination of interior elements is visual; surfaces, coverings, and obstructions are not
        disturbed in the course of the examination. If observed, the inspector will report signs of abnormal or harmful
        water penetration into the building or signs of abnormal or harmful condensation on building components. The
        inspection is not a guarantee all areas may be discovered during a single visit home inspection and
        we&nbsp;recommended having your home inspected at least every other year.&nbsp;This examination does not
        typically include assessment for air quality, moisture problems that may result in visible or concealed mold
        growth, the presence of toxic or hazardous materials, the presence of radon gas, and contaminants either present
        from construction or past use of the property.&nbsp;</p>

              <div><b>INTERIOR SURFACE FINISHES: </b>Interior finishes provide for the decorative surfaces of walls and
                ceilings,&nbsp;are most commonly applied as drywall; other common materials include paneling, tile,
                wood, and plaster. Ceilings may also have a textured finish, usually trowelled or sprayed on. These
                surfaces should get monitored for change over time: minor cracks may appear, usually at edges and
                corners, which are often due to normal construction material shrinkage. However, cracks of irregular
                shape and greater than hairline in size may be an indication of structural change and should get
                investigated.</div>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
              <div><b>FLOOR FINISHES: </b>Floors provide a durable surface for foot traffic, and are usually a
                combination of materials that may include carpeting, hardwood flooring, laminate flooring, stone or
                ceramic tile, or resilient flooring. Hardwood and wood laminate floors are susceptible to change due to
                humidity, and efforts to control humidity, as either wood shrinkage or swelling can have both cosmetic
                and functional impacts.</div>

      <div><strong>CABINETS AND COUNTERTOPS</strong>: Cabinets provide space for storage while countertops provide
        working surfaces, usually located in the kitchen, laundry, and bathroom areas of the home.&nbsp;The appearance
        of water stains in Bathrooms and Kitchen cabinets is a very common issue and can easily not get reported&nbsp;on
        during inspection due to personal items in these locations. Personal items are not moved during an inspection.
        Water-damaged interior cabinet bottoms are also not reported on unless it is new construction.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div><strong>STAIRS: </strong>Stairs provide the means of access to different levels of the home. Safe passage is
        reliant on sound design and construction practices, with provision for handrails and guards to reduce the risk
        of fall injuries. Although the need for repairs is minimal, stairs and railings should be monitored and
        maintained with safety as the primary consideration.</div>

        <p><strong>DOORS: </strong>The primary purpose of interior doors is to meet the privacy needs of various rooms
          and areas of the home, or in the case of closets, to enclose storage areas. Wood is the most common material
          used indoor fabrication, although door styles include glass and mirror panes or panels. Door fit and
          operation, as well as hardware, may be subject to adjustment and maintenance. Note: Exterior Glass doors
          without tempered glass may be considered a potential safety hazard.</p>
      </div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div><strong>WINDOWS: </strong>The primary purpose of windows is to provide light and ventilation to the home.
        Typical window sash and frame materials include vinyl, metal, and wood. Maintenance needs vary with the type and
        style of windows; generally, windows should get periodically checked for operation, weather tightness, and
        deterioration. As well, sealed panes should be monitored for loss of seal, and may require repair or replacement
        as needed. &nbsp;Consider an&nbsp;Examination&nbsp;for the presence of condensation on windows during cold
        weather. Often the cause of condensation or ice on windows is due to high humidity levels in the structure, in
        which case efforts to control humidity should be investigated and implemented. Improving airflow at windows may
        also help to reduce the occurrence of condensation, such as opening blinds or curtains, and ensuring air from
        forced-air registers is directed towards the windows. Note: Exterior Glass windows without tempered glass may be
        considered a potential safety hazard when the&nbsp;risk of falling is present.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div><b>FIREPLACES AND STOVES: </b>Fireplaces and stoves are generally installed in homes for aesthetic reasons
        and ambiance, although these may also serve to provide heating. Proper design, installation, and maintenance are
        essential. Wood stoves and fireplaces require particular attention, due to the build-up of creosote in chimneys,
        which can become a fire hazard. Care in the use and maintenance of fuel-burning appliances should be regarded as
        the primary considerations for safety.</div>

                    technology is evolving and current technology is going in the direction of recommending that only
                    Photoelectric smoke alarms be installed in the home due to the nuisance tripping and other human
                    factors involved with misuse and maintenance associated with Ionization type smoke alarms. It is not
                    possible in the context of the home inspection to determine why types of alarms are installed in the
                    home. You are encouraged to install and maintain any type of alarm in the home and you are
                    encouraged to upgrade alarms to photoelectric type alarms. Contact your Local Fire Department for an
                    inspection of your home&#39;s fire safety systems. </span></span></div>

                    be tested and have their batteries replaced. It is recommended that Carbon Monoxide detectors that
                    are older than 5 years should be replaced by a licensed electrical contractor if they are
                    hardâu0080u0090wired, and replaced by the homeowner/handyperson if they are battery operated. These
                    devices are currently required, according to Washington State Law to be maintained by the
                    tenant/homeowner according to the manufacturer&#39;s recommendations/instructions. For optimum
                    safety, Carbon Monoxide alarm/detectors are required in the immediate vicinity of bedrooms and on
                    each floor level of the home. Alarm/detectors must be maintained free of dust and debris which can
                    interfere with operation. Please be aware that residential Carbon Monoxide detectors are cumulative
                    and are designed to not sound with low levels of carbon monoxide. Some people are more susceptible
                    than others to low levels of carbon monoxide and I consider it prudent to familiarize yourself with
                    the symptoms/warning signs of Carbon Monoxide. Detectors that meet the ULâu0080u00902034
                    requirements for detectors installed in residential construction are not allowed to sound at
                    continuous CO levels up to 30 ppm, 70 ppm for 4 hours, 150 ppm for up to 50 minutes, and 400 ppm for

        a qualified water intrusion specialist, as this is a visual, non-destructive inspection to point out potential
        issues as they are apparent and visible at this time. Be aware that additional defects may be discovered during
        a more comprehensive evaluation by an appropriate professional.&nbsp;</div>

              <div><em>We inspect a representative number of windows and doors, switches, and outlets. We do not
                  evaluate window treatments, move furnishings or possessions, lift carpets or rugs, empty closets or
                  cabinets. We may not comment on cracks that appear around windows and doors, along with the lines of
                  framing members or along seams of drywall and plasterboard. &nbsp;Caused by minor movements, such as
                  wood shrinkage, natural settling, and seismic activity, and will often reappear if not correctly
                  repaired.&nbsp; Such cracks can become the subject of disputes, and are therefore best evaluated by a
                  specialist. We do not verify whether all walls, floors, ceilings, doorways, cabinets, and window
                  openings are square, straight, level or plumb. We do not report on cosmetic conditions related to the
                  condition of interior components. Note: Determining the condition of the waterproofing on interior
                  below-grade walls is outside the scope of this inspection. Interior walls are visually inspected for
                  stains and damage inaccessible areas that are not blocked or covered by occupant&rsquo;s
                  belongings.&nbsp;</em></div>
              <div><em>Floor covering such as carpeting and rugs do not get lifted. Hidden damage or stains may exist
                  before close buyers should verify with owner floor conditions. &nbsp;Determining the effectiveness of
                  insulated glass windows is not always possible due to temperature, weather, and lighting
                  conditions.&nbsp; Check with owners for further information. &nbsp; All fireplaces should be cleaned
                  and inspected on a regular basis to make sure that no cracks have developed.&nbsp; Large fires in the
                  firebox can overheat the firebox and flue liners, sometimes resulting in internal damage. Testing,
                  identifying, or identifying the source of environmental pollutants or odors (including but not limited
                  to lead, mold, allergens, odors from household pets, and cigarette smoke) is beyond the scope of our
                  service, but can become equally contentious or challenging to eradicate. The conditions inside walls,
                  behind occupant&rsquo;s stuff, behind wallpaper or paneling, under flooring, and areas not visible
                  cannot be judged and are not inspected. Do a careful check during the final walkthrough.&nbsp;</em>

              <div><br /><em>Identification, investigation, or recommendations regarding MOLD and/or the presence of
                  MOLD are outside the scope of this inspection. Any comments made are as a courtesy and may not address

                  determine and schedule whatever remedial services may be deemed advisable or necessary before the
                  close of escrow.</em></div>
